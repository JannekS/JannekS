### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jannek. I have a genuine passion for coding, I see beauty in clean code and I live to learn. 
Comming from a Social Sciences background, the curiosity for what was behind my fancy home screen led me to Linux and and bash, from there to programming languages and concepts and finally to web development, which for me is a great combination of analytical thinking/problem-solving and aesthetics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and testing.
